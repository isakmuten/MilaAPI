/* MILA – Money, Investments, Ledger, Analysis

Overview:
MILA is designed to simplify personal finance management by automatically 
retrieving and categorizing expenses from payments made through Apple Pay 
or Android Pay. The aim is to provide users with a seamless experience in 
managing their finances, with a focus on user-friendly functionality and
accessibility.

Tagline:
"Money made easy with MILA."

Core Features:
1. Automatic Expense Tracking:
   * Whenever a payment is made via Apple Pay or Android Pay, the app detects 
   the transaction and prompts the user to add it to their expense log.

   * Option to enable an "auto-add" feature, where transactions are added 
   automatically without user confirmation.

2. Expense Categorization and Summarization:
   * Transactions are retrieved and automatically categorized (e.g., food, 
	clothing, transportation), providing an easy-to-read summary.

   * Generates daily, weekly, and monthly reports, helping users track 
	their spending over time.

3. Daily Notifications:
   * The app sends daily reminders showing how much has been spent that day, 
	 helping users stay on top of their spending and avoid overspending.

4. Bank Account Integration (if feasible):
   * If possible, the app can connect to bank accounts or credit cards to 
	 track expenses made outside of Apple Pay or Android Pay, offering a 
	 comprehensive view of the user’s finances.

5. Customization and User Preferences:
   * Users can customize notifications (e.g., receiving daily summaries 
	 at specific times) or set up weekly or monthly alerts.

   * Options to exclude certain expense categories from daily summaries.

6. Security and Privacy:
   * Given the sensitive nature of financial data, the app ensures robust 
	 encryption and offers user-friendly privacy settings.


Technical Challenges and Solutions:
1. API Integrations:
   * The app would need to leverage the APIs provided by Apple Pay and Android Pay 
	 to automatically log payments. Collaboration with third-party actors or 
	 banks might be required to access transaction data.

2. Data Protection:
   * The app must comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and have 
	 robust security features to protect sensitive financial information.

3. User Experience (UX):
   * The app must be intuitive and not overly intrusive with notifications 
	 or prompts. By offering customizable settings, users can tailor the 
	 experience to suit their preferences.

Additional Features:
1. Budgeting and Alerts:
   * Users can set budgets for different categories (e.g., a monthly 
	 food budget of $300), and the app will alert them when they 
	 approach or exceed their limits.

2. Data Visualization:
   * Use charts and graphs to visually represent spending by category, 
	 over time, etc., making it easier for users to analyze their habits.

3. Export Functionality:
   * Allow users to export expense data to Excel or PDF for further analysis.

4. Shared Accounts:
   * For couples or families, a feature to share and track joint expenses 
	 would be highly practical.

Next Steps:
1. Market Research:
   * Conduct research on existing budget and finance apps to identify 
	 potential gaps. Explore the niche of automatic transaction tracking 
	 and how MILA can stand out.

2. Wireframing and Prototyping:
   * Create initial sketches (wireframes) of the app’s interface. 
	 Focus on how the home screen, notifications, and daily reports should look.

Future Implementations:
1. Default Saving Goals Setup:
   * Help new users get started with suggested saving goals, such as "Emergency Fund" 
	 or "Vacation Fund," with pre-set targets and visual progress trackers.

2. Experience Points for Reaching Goals:
   * Introduce a gamified system where users earn experience points (XP) 
	 for reaching savings milestones, progressing toward levels 
	 such as Bronze, Silver, and Gold etc.

3. Levels System:
   * As users accumulate XP, they advance through different levels, unlocking 
	 rewards such as discounts, exclusive offers, or badges that recognize their achievements.

4. Reward System:
   * Offer cashback, discounts, or premium features for users who 
	 achieve specific financial milestones or reach higher levels.

Philosophy:
By implementing gamified rewards and promoting the idea that 
"saving money allows for responsible spending," 
MILA incentivizes users to balance saving and spending responsibly.*/
